This is a patched version of Andrew McCallum's libbow/rainbow text classification software.
It's from the latest (unmaintained) 20020213 version,
but patched so that it compiles on modern GCC (4.0.1) and on Mac OSX (10.5)
That's the only compiler/platform combination I've tried.
Please see README.orig.txt for the original rainbow README.
Some of the necessary code changes are described in http://fugutabetai.com/?postid=170
